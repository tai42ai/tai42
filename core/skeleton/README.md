# tai42-skeleton

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The open-source implementation of `tai42-contract` — the extended MCP server that
hosts tools, agents, extensions, connectors, hooks, and storage for the TAI
ecosystem. It provides the concrete `TaiMCP` server and the runtime engines
(tool registry and adapters, the agent registry, the OAuth connector engine, the
access-control middleware, the hooks router, the template/storage manager, the
manifest loader, and the transport layer) that implement the protocols declared
in `tai42-contract`.

Providers — OAuth connectors, storage backends, config providers, worker
backends, monitoring — ship as separate plugins that register through the
`tai42_app` contract handle when the manifest loads them; no plugin imports the
skeleton.

## Position in the ecosystem

TAI is an open-source runtime for MCP tools, agents, and workflows — the server
that hosts a capability and supplies the operational layer around it (manifest
loading, access control, OAuth connectors, background execution, monitoring,
storage, and human-in-the-loop steps).

Three packages; each depends only on the ones to its left:

```
tai42-contract  <--  tai42-kit  <--  tai42-skeleton
(interfaces)      (helpers)     (the server)
```

`tai42-skeleton` is the server at the end of the chain: it depends on **only**
`tai42-contract` (the pure interface package) and `tai42-kit` (generic leaf
helpers). It is the runnable body every plugin plugs into.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.13+**. Install from PyPI into the environment that runs the
server:

```bash
uv add tai42-skeleton
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tai42ai/tai42
cd core/skeleton
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install --no-sources --editable .
```

Add the `toolbox` extra for batteries — it pulls in the `tai42-toolbox` contrib
package, whose composition tool extensions (`chain`, `batch`) and generic tool
collection load from the manifest (see [`examples/toolbox`](examples/toolbox)):

```bash
uv add "tai42-skeleton[toolbox]"                      # from PyPI
uv pip install --no-sources --editable ".[toolbox]"   # from a source checkout
```

## Run it

The hello-world app in [`examples/hello`](examples/hello) registers one local
`greet` tool and needs no services to stand up. From the repo root:

```bash
ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLE=false \
PYTHONPATH=examples/hello \
uv run --no-sync tai serve --manifest-path examples/hello/manifest.yml --port 8765
```

The MCP endpoint is then `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`, and it lists 94 tools, not
one: alongside `greet` the server projects 93 **operation tools** from its own
management operations, because the manifest's `api_tools` block is on by
default. Set `api_tools: {enabled: false}` to switch that projection off and
leave `greet` on its own. The server also polls the marketplace for security
advisories on a timer — that is its one outbound call, and
`MARKETPLACE_ADVISORIES_POLL=false` turns it off.

`tai backend` runs the agent/worker backend process and `tai metrics` serves the
Prometheus endpoint; the full command surface is in the CLI reference below.

`tai serve`, `tai backend`, and `tai metrics` form one run family over a single
shared Prometheus multiprocess directory (`PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR`, default a
fixed absolute path under the host temp dir; any override must be absolute).
Point all three at the same directory and restart them together: `tai serve`
clears the directory once at boot, so restarting it mid-run while a backend
worker is still writing orphans that worker's counters until the whole family
restarts.
[`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) walks through the examples, and
[`examples/manifest.yml`](examples/manifest.yml) is the commented manifest
reference.

## The worker bus

When a deployment runs more than one process — several `tai serve` workers, a
`tai backend` runtime alongside the server, or multiple pods sharing one config —
a manifest edit on one process must reach the others, or siblings serve stale
state. The **worker bus** is how every process converges: each subscribes to one
Redis channel at startup, a mutation applies locally and is then broadcast, and
the response carries a per-origin report of how every worker fared.

The bus is **internal app infrastructure, like the reload gate — it is NOT a
plugin.** Nothing about it is registrable, swappable, or user-selectable; there is
exactly one bus and no manifest field chooses an implementation. It is configured
only by environment: set `TAI_BUS_REDIS_URL` (plus the optional `TAI_BUS_*` knobs)
to turn it on. A single-worker, file-mode, no-backend deployment needs no bus and
runs on a no-op local variant; a multi-worker, backend-bearing, or `k8s`-mode boot
refuses to start without one, naming `TAI_BUS_REDIS_URL`. On a shared Redis,
`TAI_BUS_NAMESPACE` must diverge per stack — Redis pub/sub is server-global, so
co-tenant deployments would otherwise cross-talk.

## Development

Set up the dev venv and run the gates. `--no-sources` ignores the workspace-source
overrides in `[tool.uv.sources]`, so the dev deps come from PyPI and the clone stands
alone; `--no-sync` runs each gate against that environment instead of re-resolving:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install --no-sources --editable ".[dev]"
uv run --no-sync ruff check .
uv run --no-sync ruff format --check .
uv run --no-sync pyright
uv run --no-sync pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```
