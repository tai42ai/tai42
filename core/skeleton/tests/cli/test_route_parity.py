"""The CLI↔route parity gate.

Every registered ``/api/*`` route the server exposes must be reachable from the
terminal. This asserts ``registered_routes - allowlist`` is a subset of
``covered_routes``, where the covered set is built from the ``@covers(...)``
attribution every remote command declares and the registered set comes from WP4's
shared enumeration primitive
:func:`load_api_routes` — the SAME primitive the OpenAPI coverage gate uses.

A newly added ``/api/*`` route with no CLI command FAILS this test loudly, so the
parity can never silently drift. A route deliberately withheld from the CLI is named
in the explicit allowlist below (its caller is a browser / external non-operator or
it serves assets — not an operator function).
