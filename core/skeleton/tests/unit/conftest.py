"""Auto-reset every cached settings accessor between tests so a
``monkeypatch.setenv`` in one test can't bleed into the next via a cached value.

Does not undo the import-time constant capture in
``tools/adapters/mcp_tool_to_func.py`` — that needs a re-import, out of scope here.

Also binds the process app singleton to the ``tai42_app`` contract handle before
the test modules are imported: the router modules (imported by
``test_universal_webhook``) register their routes through the handle at import
time, exactly as external plugins do, and the runtime imports them only after
``start()`` binds the handle.
