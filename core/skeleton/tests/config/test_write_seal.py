"""The config-manager raw-write seal.

Every manifest / env mutation must cross the one pipeline
(:class:`~tai42_skeleton.config.service.ConfigService`), so feature code must never call
the config manager's raw write seams directly — ``mutate_manifest``,
``replace_manifest``, ``write_manifest``, and ``write_env`` — only the config layer
(``config/``, including ``ConfigService``) and the config managers themselves may.
This test statically scans the shipped ``tai42_skeleton`` feature modules and asserts
ZERO direct calls, so a converged writer cannot quietly regress to a raw seam.

The config manager's raw write seams are instance methods, reachable in source only as
an attribute call ``<manager>.mutate_manifest(...)`` and so on (a bare re-export would
still call the method as an attribute at its own body). Detecting attribute calls by
method name therefore seals every seam completely; scanning the AST (not the text)
ignores the method names where they appear only in docstrings, comments, or the
``ConfigService`` protocol declaration.
