"""D.1 universal-authz sweep — the core LIVE-stack security proof.

Boots the app through the real ``app.app_context`` harness with an ``api_tools``
manifest (no management tool modules loaded, projection enabled) that also wires
every dispatch-derivative the sweep must cover, then dispatches each modality
through the REAL ``AuthzMiddleware.on_call_tool`` installed on the booted
FastMCP surfaces — proving that, with access control ENABLED, a caller with no
resolvable identity (or insufficient scope) is DENIED and the denial surfaces as a
``ToolError`` specifically backed by :class:`PermissionDenied` (never a generic
error, never a silent allow), with ALLOW parity for a sufficient identity and for
``ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLE=false``.

The modalities (cases a-e):
  (a) a plain projected op dispatched via MCP (``remove_tool``);
  (a-priv) an INCLUDED tier-2 privileged op (``update_manifest``) — so the sweep
      is never vacuous (a real privileged op is on the surface);
  (b) a BACKEND-kind combo over a projected op (``remove_tool`` + ``backendswap``)
      — the execution-relocating case, proving the check fires caller-side BEFORE
      the extension/transform chain (before any backend enqueue), not worker-side;
  (c) an in-process combo over a projected op (``remove_tool`` + ``argswrap``);
  (d) a PRESET baked over a projected op (proving the name→base-op resolver
      consults ``PresetManager``, not just the extension-branch map);
  (e) the same projected op reachable through a SUB-MCP MOUNT (``/app/{slug}``),
      proving ``AuthzMiddleware`` is installed on the sub-app's FastMCP, not only
      the main server.

For every modality the denial is asserted to be the ``PermissionDenied``-backed
``ToolError`` SPECIFICALLY (type + message), and ``call_next`` is proven NOT
reached on a deny — mechanically enforcing "no projected tool is dispatchable
externally without a check, on any MCP surface, through any derivative".
