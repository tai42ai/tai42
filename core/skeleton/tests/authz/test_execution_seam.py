"""The tool-dispatch seam on the live stack: the decision a dispatch takes under a bound
execution identity.

Boots the real registries over a faked policy store and dispatches through the real
``tools/binding.py`` seams (``run_tool`` and the ``get_client_tools`` runnable). An
OPERATION tool takes the full route-edge decision (scope/jq pass AND per-tag LEVEL pass);
a CAPABILITY tool (non-operation) takes liveness only. With no identity bound the seam is
a strict no-op. The two operation classes come from ``tests.authz._fixtures.execution_probe``.
