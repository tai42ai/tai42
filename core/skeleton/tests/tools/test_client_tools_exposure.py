"""``get_client_tools`` exposure of injected-param and preset tools, and the argument
mapping a client-tool call is decided on.

An injected fastmcp ``Context`` param must NOT reach the advertised client-tool
schema (the LLM would be asked to supply it), and the client tool must still run
through the in-process ``bridge_context`` so ``ctx.sample()`` falls back to the
platform LLM — exactly as ``run_tool`` does. A preset (a ``TransformedTool``) is
resolved to its baked partial and exposed too, serving the baked constant and
rejecting a baked key.

The runnable presents a permissive ``*args``/``**kwargs`` front, so a call may arrive
positionally, through a catch-all, or carrying the ``_UNSET`` sentinel.
``_named_call_arguments`` normalizes all of it into the by-parameter-name mapping the
execution-identity decision reads — an argument landing under the wrong name is a
wrongly-refused fire, so each shape is pinned.
