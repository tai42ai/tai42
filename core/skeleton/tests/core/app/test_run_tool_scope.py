"""``ToolBinding.run_tool`` is pure dispatch — it opens NO span. Tool spans
are owned by the flow interrupt-resume seam and the agent callbacks; a plain
``run_tool`` (standalone / hook / worker) is untraced unless a tool opts into
the ``:monitor`` extension.

This drives the real validate/call/extract path (no mocked adapter) so tool-body
extraction is genuinely exercised, against a mock monitoring backend whose writer
records calls installed through the process registry — proving dispatch touches
neither ``start_span`` nor ``record_span``.
