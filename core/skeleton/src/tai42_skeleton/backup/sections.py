"""The host's own backup sections — the skeleton as the first consumer of its
own ``app.backup`` facet.

Each section is a THIN exporter/importer pair over the owning subsystem's
existing read/write seam; no backup logic lives inside the subsystems. An
exporter returns a JSON-safe payload; an importer applies a payload and returns a
section report ``{"created", "updated", "skipped", "errors"}`` (the
``access_control`` importer additionally carries ``"new_api_keys"``; the ``manifest``
and ``env`` importers additionally carry ``"fanout"`` — the per-origin fleet report of
the reload their pipeline apply broadcast). A section
whose backing subsystem is absent lets the underlying seam raise, and the HTTP
router catches it per-section into the report; the registry and these functions
never swallow it.

The exporters/importers reference the live subsystems through the ``tai42_app``
handle (or a feature accessor) at call time, so a section is a pure closure over
the running app, not a snapshot taken at registration.

The manifest section exports the preserved-``!ENV`` view, so an ``!ENV``
placeholder never leaves the host as a resolved secret; a value the operator wrote
as a literal (not an ``!ENV`` placeholder) exports as-is — the same exposure as
``manifest.yml`` itself — so anything that must never leave the host belongs behind
an ``!ENV`` placeholder.

The connector tables are backed up at the SQL layer through
``connectors.store.backup`` (Postgres is their source of truth, so the section
reads/writes rows directly rather than through the network-gated service layer):
``connector_catalog`` carries the categories, the full catalog including disabled
rows, and the allowed-source list; ``connector_connections`` carries each token
record's ciphertext verbatim under the same KEK constraint that module documents.

The ``schedules`` section is opaque: it exports through the scheduling backend's
own ``backend_export_schedules`` door and imports through
``backend_import_schedules``, carrying the backend's document as-is without
parsing schedule internals. When no scheduling backend is installed those tools
are absent, so ``run_tool`` raises the unknown-tool error and the backup router
records it per-section — a bound backend round-trips, an unbound one reports the
absence loudly.
