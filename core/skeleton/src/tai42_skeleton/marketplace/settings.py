"""Pydantic-settings for the marketplace client.

Two co-located groups: :class:`MarketplaceSettings` (``MARKETPLACE_*``) — the
registry endpoint plus the advisory-poll knobs — and
:class:`MarketplaceStorePgSettings` (``MARKETPLACE_STORE_*``) — the Postgres
connection for the ``marketplace_installs`` attribution table, kept in its own
namespace like the versioning / connector stores so each durable store declares
its own DSN. It targets the same ``tai`` database by default.

The advisory poll is the ONLY background outbound call this feature makes, and
it is a visible, documented setting: ``MARKETPLACE_ADVISORIES_POLL`` defaults to
on, the startup log names the polled URL, and one env var turns it off. Nothing
else is ever sent to the registry without an explicit operator request.
