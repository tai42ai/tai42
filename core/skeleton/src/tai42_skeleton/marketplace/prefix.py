"""The plugin prefix: a persistent install root for marketplace plugin
distributions, kept apart from the platform's own environment packages (the
wp-content principle — plugin files live separate from the platform's packages).

``TAI_PLUGINS_PREFIX`` unset -> installs go into the running interpreter
environment, which a container image discards on restart (today's behavior).
Set -> the deployment OPTS IN to persistence: the installer installs each plugin's
OWN distribution into the prefix while pip resolves shared dependencies against the
running environment, so a package already importable in the environment is never
copied into the prefix (only genuinely-new dependencies land there), and boot adds
the prefix's site directories to the END of ``sys.path`` so the environment shadows
the prefix for any package present in both.

The dependency rule is pip's own: ``pip install --prefix`` resolves against the
running environment and installs only the distributions that environment does not
already satisfy, so the image's ``tai42-contract`` / ``tai42-kit`` / … always win
and are never duplicated in the prefix. Uninstall does NOT shell pip — pip refuses
to remove a distribution installed outside its own environment — so it removes the
plugin's own files from the prefix directly, by the ``RECORD`` its ``.dist-info``
ships, leaving every dependency in place (the same "only the named distribution is
removed" boundary the environment path has).
