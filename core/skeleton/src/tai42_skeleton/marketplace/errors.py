"""The typed failure hierarchy the marketplace client and installer raise.

Every failure family has one class under :class:`MarketplaceError`. These are
the internal, load-bearing errors: they carry the attributes the installer and
the operation boundary branch on (an HTTP status, a not-installed flag, a pip
argv + return code, the two errors of a failed unwind). The operation layer
catches them at its edge and translates each to the shared operation-error
vocabulary; nothing here leaks a raw third-party exception.
