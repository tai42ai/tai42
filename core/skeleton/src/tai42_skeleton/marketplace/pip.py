"""The pip subprocess seam: pre-flights, the runner, and pin-argv composition.

Install and uninstall shell out to ``sys.executable -m pip`` — the one mechanism
that installs into exactly the interpreter environment serving the app, working
identically in a pip-made venv, a uv-made venv, and a container. There is no uv
path and no fallback chain: one door, honest failure.

The pin handed to pip is composed LOCALLY from the registry resolve response's
validated fields (:func:`install_args`), never taken as an opaque
registry-provided string — a registry compromise must not become an
arbitrary-package install. A pypi source pins ``package==version``; a github
source installs a LOCAL tarball that :func:`fetch_verified_artifact` has already
downloaded and checksum-verified, so pip clones nothing and runs no code the
registry did not vouch for. Every one of those fields is registry data, so a
validation failure raises :class:`RegistryResponseError` (with ``status=None``,
a registry-data fault → a gateway error), never a bare ``ValueError`` the
operation layer would mis-blame on the caller.

The github integrity anchor
---------------------------
:func:`fetch_verified_artifact` downloads the registry-named artifact tarball
over the SSRF-guarded, size-capped :func:`tai42_kit.net.fetch_url`, recomputes its
sha256, and compares it to the digest the registry captured when it ingested the
release. A match yields a local tarball path pip installs directly; a MISMATCH
raises :class:`ArtifactIntegrityError` and installs nothing — a release tag
re-pointed to a different commit since ingest is refused, never silently cloned.

The pre-flight (:func:`ensure_pip_available`) is a defensive check run before any
state change — pip is a declared runtime dependency, but a uv-synced venv can
ship without it.

POSIX-only: :func:`run_pip` uses ``start_new_session`` + ``os.killpg`` to reap
pip's whole process group (including its PEP-517 build subprocesses) on
cancellation. This ecosystem targets darwin/linux.
