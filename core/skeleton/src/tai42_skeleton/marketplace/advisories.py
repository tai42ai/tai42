"""The advisory cache, its refresh, and the documented background poll.

The marketplace registry publishes security advisories per listing. This module
holds the most recent advisory snapshot for the INSTALLED plugins and keeps it
fresh two ways: on demand (:func:`current`, bounded by the configured interval)
and, when enabled, a background poll (:func:`start_poll`).

This module owns the ONLY advisory range matcher in the skeleton: the installer
never matches ranges itself (the resolve call returns advisories already matched
to the pinned version by the registry). Here, a listing's advisory applies to an
installed plugin when it is not withdrawn and its PEP 440 ``affected_versions``
specifier set contains the installed version (``prereleases=True`` so an
installed prerelease is not silently excluded).

The poll is the ONLY background outbound call the feature makes, and it is a
visible, documented setting: ``MARKETPLACE_ADVISORIES_POLL`` defaults on, the
startup emits a loud line naming the polled URL and interval, and one env var
turns it off. Under ``uvicorn --workers N`` each worker process runs its own poll
task and its own cache — N duplicate polls per interval — acceptable for this
cadence and stated deliberately.

Loop ownership matters. The startup hook runs on the serving loop, so it may
spawn the poll task and remembers that loop. Reload hooks do NOT run there — the
dispatch runs them via ``asyncio.run`` on a throwaway worker-thread loop — so
:func:`restart_poll_from_reload` marshals the restart back onto the remembered
serving loop (fire-and-forget), never spawning a task onto a loop that is torn
down the instant the handler returns.
