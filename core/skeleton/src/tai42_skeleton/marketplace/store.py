"""Postgres-backed attribution store for marketplace-installed plugins.

One row per installed listing in ``marketplace_installs``: the listing ``ref``
(``namespace/name``), the exact installed ``version``, the artifact ``source``
(``pypi``/``github``), the github ``repository_url`` + ``tag`` the pin came from
(both ``None`` for a pypi source), the github ``artifact_ref`` + ``sha256`` the
verified install fetched from (both ``None`` for a pypi source, whose immutable
``package==version`` needs no fetch), and the full ``PluginSpec`` document that
version shipped (``spec``, JSONB). Storing the spec locally is what lets
uninstall unpatch the manifest without asking the registry, and lets
``installed``/``update``/``advisories`` answer from local truth; storing the
github artifact_ref + sha256 is what lets update-unwind reinstall the old pin
through the same download-and-verify path the forward install took.

Written only by the installer: :meth:`~MarketplaceInstallStore.record` serves
both install and update (the update flow replaces the row), :meth:`delete`
drops it on uninstall. There is no cache layer — the table is read on operator
requests and the advisory-poll cadence, never on a hot per-request path.

Postgres is reached through the app-pooled ``PostgresClient`` (module-level
``client_ctx`` import so tests can monkeypatch the seam), sharing one pool per
DSN with the other durable stores and closed centrally at shutdown.
