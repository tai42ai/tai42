"""Public ASGI application factory for a user-owned tai server process.

``create_app`` is the programmatic entry point for embedding the tai MCP
application inside a host-owned ASGI process — a plain ``uvicorn main:app`` run or
a mount inside an existing FastAPI/Starlette host:

```python
from tai42_skeleton.asgi import create_app

app = create_app(manifest_path="manifest.yml")
```

The returned Starlette app carries the full worker lifespan (manifest load,
``app_context``, transport selection, and the inner FastMCP lifespan), so the host
serves it exactly as the runtime CLI serves its own workers.

One app per process. The ``tai42_app`` contract handle and the built app are
process-global singletons, so a second ``create_app`` lifespan entered while one
is already active raises loudly rather than silently rebinding the handle;
sequential lifespans in one process (enter -> exit -> enter) stay legal.

Deliberately CLI-owned and absent here: root-logger configuration (an embedded
app never touches the host's logging), the Prometheus multiprocess metrics
environment (the embedded app serves its own in-app ``/metrics`` route in
IN-PROCESS mode, rendering this process's default registry; it does not set up the
MULTIPROCESS dir — a separate reader over a shared multiproc dir is yours to run),
and process-fleet orchestration. Fleet config-reload fan-out is the app's internal
worker bus: an embedded worker joins it like any other process when
``TAI_BUS_REDIS_URL`` is set (the rules cannot count sibling processes in an
embedded host, so set it in any multi-process embed).
