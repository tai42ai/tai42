"""Process-global registry for the monitoring backend.

Access is a free global (``get_monitoring()``), not hung off the app:
monitoring is foundational infra below the app, most emit sites have no app
handle, and the framework's own internals emit (so they cannot import the app
to reach it).

Monitoring is optional: with no plugin registered, ``get_monitoring()`` returns
a shared ``NoOpMonitoring`` default — there is exactly one place a real backend
is installed, the ``@tai42_app.monitoring.register_monitoring`` plugin, mirroring how
backend/template register. Callers never seed the no-op themselves.

The registered backend is plain process memory: a forked worker child inherits
it across ``fork()``, so ``get_monitoring()`` keeps working post-fork —
``init_monitoring()`` is not re-called per child. Only the inner vendor client
dies on fork; the writer's ``shutdown()`` evicts and rebuilds it.
