    silently skips one. Each such route must fall into exactly ONE bucket, or the boot
    FAILS closed:

    * consciously ACKNOWLEDGED public — its REGISTERED path (the template string for a
      templated route) is in ``acknowledged_public_routes``. This is a registry-level
      match: templates are ordinary keys. The operational probes, the webhook ingress
      door, and the SPA shell catch-all itself are the app's acknowledged public GETs;
    * gated by AUTHZ (``authed=True``) AND visible to the fallback derivation — a CONCRETE
      authed route is in the DERIVED reserved set (the shell fallback skips it, so an
      unmapped request terminal-denies rather than being served the shell). A TEMPLATED
      ``authed=True`` route is structurally NOT derivable into the concrete reserved set:
      a concrete request matching its pattern with no route row would be served the public
      shell, so the boot FAILS it (the author must ``/api``-prefix it — control-plane
      excluded — or consciously acknowledge it), the same posture as the always-public
      authed refusal;
    * ``authed=False`` and NOT acknowledged → the boot FAILS: a boot-log flag is not a
      control; a publicly declared non-API GET must be a consciously reviewed decision.

    ``/api``/``/mcp`` routes (concrete and templated alike) are excluded: ``serve_spa``
    404s them, so the shell tier can never reach them regardless of auth or templating.
    The fallback state and the derived + acknowledged surfaces are printed so drift and the
    public-by-declaration vs shell-fallback split stay reviewable in ops logs. The audit's
    exhaustiveness is what lets the runtime fallback (concrete-match only) rely on it for
    templated routes rather than build a second matcher — see ``resolve_resource_ids``.

    Finally it confirms the terminal-deny exclusion: a ``/api``/``/mcp`` probe is
    segment-under the excluded prefixes, so the GET fallback can never open the control
    plane. (Exercised end-to-end by the terminal-deny + route-walk tests.)
