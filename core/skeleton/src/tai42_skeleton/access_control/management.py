"""Provisioning surface over the access-control policy store.

The auth gate (``policy``/``verifier`` + the identity provider) is the read side:
it resolves an inbound key to an identity, loads that identity's policy, and maps a
request path to a scope id. This module is the write side — the CRUD an operator
UI drives to mint keys, edit policies, and wire routes to scopes.

Three backends are orchestrated here, each owning a distinct slice of state:

- The POLICY RULES (scopes, route/pattern mappings, per-user policy bodies) live in
  Postgres — the :class:`~tai42_skeleton.access_control.store.PostgresAccessControlStore`
  this module delegates every policy op to. It is the ONLY policy store.
- The api-key IDENTITY record (key hash → ``{user_id, description}`` plus its
  ``user_id`` → hash reverse lookup) is OWNED by the active identity provider (the
  ``tai42-identity-redis`` plugin for ``auth_providers=["redis"]``), reached ONLY through
  the ``ApiKeyIdentityProvider`` API (``provision``/``revoke``/``update_description``/
  ``list_identities``) resolved through the module-level registry the runtime auth
  adapter uses — this module never imports the plugin nor touches ``ac:key:*``.
- The ``ac:context:{user_id}`` per-user LIVE COUNTERS are a plain Redis HASH on the
  AC Redis, created by the first counter write (external metering writers use
  ``HSET``/``HINCRBY`` with JSON-encoded values) and deleted at revoke here; the
  plain-Redis ``ac:policy_version`` cache-buster is bumped here after every mutation.

Backend errors are never swallowed — they propagate so a failed provisioning op is
loud. The mint/revoke orchestration is fail-closed (identity record first on mint,
policy row first on revoke); a failure mid-way raises loudly rather than leaving a
silent orphan, and every step is ordered so a plain retry finishes the job.

    records it as durable version history without re-reading the store), and the fresh

    non-reusable identity a hook binding resolves against at fire, so a revoke+remint of
    the same ``user_id`` leaves an old binding resolving to nothing.

    When ``owner_user_id`` is given the key is an OWNED key: the owner claim is
    DUAL-HOMED at this single mint — the provider persists it on the identity record
    (the ENFORCEMENT source, arriving on every request) and it is also written into the
    committed ``policy_data`` under ``OWNER_USER_ID_CLAIM`` (the MANAGEMENT/listing
    source, readable from the store the tokens-payload merge already performs). Both

    ORCHESTRATES the backends in a FAIL-CLOSED order. Raises ``ValueError`` if the

    1. the provider's ``provision`` writes the identity/key record FIRST — the key
       authenticates but GRANTS NOTHING until the policy below exists;
    2. the policy row is written to the PG store.

    The per-user live-context hash ``ac:context:{user_id}`` needs NO seed — a Redis
    hash is created by its first counter write, and an absent hash reads as an empty
    live context via ``HGETALL``.

    A failure in step 2 RAISES loudly: the key exists but is denied everything, so
