"""Postgres-backed access-control POLICY store.

The enforced authorization rules: per-user policy bodies and the route/scope +
dynamic-pattern mappings the auth gate reads and the management surface writes.
Postgres is the SOLE store for these rules; there is no second backend and no
selection knob.

Scope of this store — POLICY RULES ONLY. Two live counter surfaces stay in Redis
and never touch this store: the plain-Redis ``ac:policy_version`` cache-buster and
the plain-Redis ``ac:context:*`` per-user live-counter hashes (deleted by the
revoke orchestration in ``management``; created by the first counter write). The
api-key IDENTITY record (key hash -> ``{user_id, description}``) is owned by the
identity provider's own storage, reached only through the ``ApiKeyIdentityProvider``
API — never here.

Mirrors :class:`~tai42_skeleton.versioning.store.PostgresVersionedStore`: Postgres is
reached through the app-pooled ``PostgresClient`` via ``client_ctx`` so it shares
one pool per DSN, and every multi-row mutation runs inside one ``conn.transaction()``
(real ACID), so consistency rides ordinary transactional SQL with no optimistic-lock
retry loop. Identities are column VALUES (parameterized,
injection-safe), so there is no identifier charset guard: an OIDC subject
containing ``:``/``@``/unicode is a plain bound value. Scope membership is DERIVED
(``WHERE scope_id = %s``), with no reverse index to keep consistent, so a scope-strip
cascade is one ``UPDATE ... array_remove`` and can never corrupt an index.

The grant-vs-remove interleave (grant a scope while its last route is being removed)
is closed by ROW-LOCK COUPLING: a grant locks the granted scopes' route rows
``FOR SHARE`` while it validates and writes the
policy, and a removal deletes those route rows (an exclusive row lock) BEFORE it
strips policies. The two lock modes conflict, so the operations serialize — a grant
either commits before the removal (which then strips the freshly-granted scope) or
runs after it and fails validation because the scope has no live route. A durable
policy therefore never holds a scope with no backing route.

The version-aware ``alru_cache`` layers stay in the verifier/enforcer on top of the
RAW reads this store exposes; the store does no caching of its own.
