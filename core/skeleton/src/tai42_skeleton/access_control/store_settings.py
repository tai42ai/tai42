"""Pydantic-settings for the access-control policy store's Postgres connection.

The policy store is a platform primitive with its own ``ACCESS_CONTROL_STORE_*``
namespace, kept separate from the connector / versioning stores so each durable
store declares its own DSN. It targets the same ``tai`` database by default; a
deployment points every store at its Postgres via the shared env.

This namespace is PURELY the PG connection config — it is NOT a store selector.
Postgres is the only policy store; there is nothing to select.
