"""The per-tag ACCESS-LEVEL gate — Layer 2 of the (resource-x-action) model.

A role's editable grant is a map ``feature-tag → none|read|write``. This module holds
the PURE decision the enforcement gate and the capability projection SHARE (never two
divergent copies): given a request's resolved route (its ``tags`` + ``action``) and a
role's grant map, decide allow/deny and name the CAUSE of any denial. It also resolves
a concrete request ``(path, method)`` to its registered :class:`RouteMetadata` so the
gate can read the route's feature tags and action-class.

The base-tier ceiling (owner-scoping, the ``/api/auth`` control-plane gate, the viewer
read-only ceiling) is a SEPARATE term carried by the seeded jq base and enforced
alongside this one — this module answers ONLY the per-tag level question plus the
admin-only fence, and the enforcement site intersects the two (fail-closed).
