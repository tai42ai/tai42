"""One-time claim links — the QR-onboarding backend.

A claim link carries a raw API key from a device that holds it to a device that does
not (a phone scanning a QR, a second terminal), WITHOUT the key ever touching a log or
a query string. Two halves:

- :func:`create_claim_link` (authed) resolves a submitted key through the SAME verifier
  chain the gate uses, applies the ownership rule, and writes a single-use record at
  ``ac:claim:<sha256(token)>`` with ``SET ... EX <ttl> NX``. The response returns the
  claim TOKEN once and a fragment-carrier PATH (``/login#claim=<token>``) — the token
  rides the URL FRAGMENT (never a query param, never a header echo), so it never reaches
  a server access log.
- :func:`exchange_claim_token` (public) burns the record with an atomic ``GETDEL`` — the
  first caller wins, every other caller (used / unknown / expired) gets the SAME 404 —
  re-validates the stored key through the verifier, and hands the raw key back once.

Security posture:

- The record is the SINGLE at-rest home of a raw key in the whole system. The raw token
  is NEVER stored; the record is findable only by ``sha256(token)`` — the identity
  store's own posture. There is NO reverse index, NO listing, and NO revoke-claim route:
  a claim is killed by waiting out the TTL or by revoking the underlying key (the
  exchange re-validation then refuses to hand out a revoked credential).
- Nothing ever logs the raw token or the raw key. Creation logs the caller + the target
  ``user_id``; exchange logs a hash PREFIX + the outcome.
- ``exchange`` guarantees the handed-out key is not REVOKED (it re-resolves through
  ``validate_token``). It does NOT re-run the owner-disable / attenuation checks that
  live in ``backend.authenticate`` — a key whose OWNER was disabled during the TTL
  window still exchanges but is correctly POWERLESS at first use (the gate 403s it via
  owner-death attenuation on every request). The guarantee is not-REVOKED, not
  owner-alive.

Every error RAISES (fail closed) — there is no fallback that could hand out or bury a
credential silently.
