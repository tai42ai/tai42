"""The preset register/reload engine — the skeleton ``PresetManager``.

Turns a preset (a base tool + baked ``fixed_kwargs`` + extension combos) into a
live named tool, and re-registers it whenever the runtime tool registry is
rebuilt. It owns three pieces of process-lifetime state, held in lockstep with
what is actually bound:

* an **authoritative in-memory spec map** ``name -> PresetBody`` (``base_tool``,
  ``description``, ``fixed_kwargs``, ``extensions``) — the source of
  truth for a registered preset's baked kwargs. The kernel bakes the values as
  hidden ``ArgTransform`` defaults with no readable closure, so both the tool
  face and the ephemeral-agent run path read baked kwargs FROM THIS MAP
  (:meth:`get_spec` / :meth:`baked_kwargs`), never from the tool object. A parallel
  ``name -> active_version`` map, captured in lockstep with the spec (from the same
  version-aware read), lets the run chokepoint attribute a dispatched preset with the
  version it is actually bound at (:meth:`active_version`);
* a **quarantine map** of names whose stored preset could not register at load
  (name taken by a foreign tool, or a missing / preset-owned base tool) to the
  human-readable reason — surfaced as ``conflicted`` records carrying that reason
  rather than bricking boot;
* the register/reload/remove/rehydrate operations over both, plus the
  :meth:`name_conflicts` predicate the :class:`PresetStoreView` consults so a
  colliding name raises before any store write.

The engine NEVER emits ``list_changed`` — routes and startup handlers own that.
It binds/rebinds the live tool from a body it is handed (or reads the ACTIVE
store body on :meth:`reload`); persistence is the route's job.
