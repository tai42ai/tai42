"""HTTP routes for the ask_user interactions surface — ``/api/interactions/*``.

Four doors:

* ``GET /api/interactions/stream`` — authenticated SSE feed: the pending-question
  backlog on connect, a ``backlog_done`` marker, then a live tail of add/answered/
  removed events.
* ``POST /api/interactions/{interaction_id}/answer`` — the authenticated human
  answer door. The value is validated server-side against the stored question's
  ``answer_format`` before the blocked caller is woken; an invalid answer is
  rejected loudly and the caller stays blocked. An EXTERNAL question is answered
  through its callback URL, never here.
* ``POST /api/interactions/callback/{ticket}`` — the UNAUTHENTICATED data door
  for external-format answers (the server-to-server / confirm-form claim path).
  Sensitive data rides the JSON body here.
* ``GET /api/interactions/callback/{ticket}`` — the UNAUTHENTICATED redirect
  door. GET never mutates state (link scanners prefetch these URLs); it serves a
  byte-constant page: for confirm/external questions the confirm page whose form
  POSTs back to the same URL, for text/select an informational awaiting-reply
  page (a bare confirm tap carries no value answer).

The callback ticket is a bearer capability minted by the ``ask_user`` helper;
it is never deleted, single-use is enforced by the answered-state guard in
``record_answer``, and a duplicate callback resolves idempotently to 200. The
callback door is NOT audience-gated — the ticket IS the authorization (an
external-answer flow deliberately addresses outsiders). That is sound because the
ticket is delivered ONLY over the configured channel: no stream or read frame ever
carries it (``_add_data`` emits no ``ticket`` field), so a restricted caller
filtered out of a question's stream can never obtain that question's ticket, and
the answer-door audience gate cannot be bypassed through this door.

Success bodies are ``{"data": {...}}``; failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
Add frames are at-least-once across the cursor/backlog window — an add landing
between cursor capture and the backlog snapshot can appear in both the backlog
and the tail; clients de-duplicate by ``interaction_id``.
