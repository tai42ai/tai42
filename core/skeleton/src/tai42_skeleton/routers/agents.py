"""HTTP routes for the agents surface — ``/api/agents`` (all AUTHED).

Four doors, bound to the :class:`~tai42_contract.agent.Agent` CONTRACT only (never
to a concrete agent implementation):

* ``GET /api/agents`` — every registered agent as ``{name, description,
  tool_name, input_schema, spec_runnable}``. ``input_schema`` is the agent's
  ``ToolInput`` JSON schema — the SAME source the agent-binding derives the
  auto-generated ``run`` tool from, so the list schema and the run-tool schema
  never diverge. ``spec_runnable`` is the agent's own capability marker (read, not
  inferred): ``True`` means baking the composable spec fields as fixed kwargs
  yields an authored agent.
* ``GET /api/agents/spec-runnable`` — only the authorable agents (``spec_runnable``
  is ``True``), the same shape as the list door. The compose UI's base-agent picker
  consumes exactly this; an empty list means no authoring is possible.
* ``POST /api/agents/{name}/runs`` — the agent's input (validated against that
  same ``ToolInput`` model; 400 on mismatch, 404 on an unknown agent). The
  validated input is mapped to ``run`` kwargs through the agent's
  ``from_tool_input`` — the SAME mapping the binding applies — and driven through
  ``agent.astream``. The response is an SSE stream: one frame per
  :class:`~tai42_contract.agent.events.StreamEvent`, a terminal ``stream.end`` when
  the iterator completes, or a terminal ``stream.error`` (and a logged traceback)
  when the agent raises. A client disconnect cancels the underlying run so an
  abandoned request never keeps executing.
* ``POST /api/agents/authored/{name}/runs`` — stream a run of an AUTHORED agent (a
  preset over an agent's run tool whose baked fields the agent honors). The baked spec
  is resolved from
  the ``PresetManager`` in-memory map (the one source of truth for every registered
  preset). The request supplies only the non-baked
  ``ToolInput`` fields; naming a baked field is a loud 400 (never a silent
  override). The baked spec plus the request fields are combined, validated against
  ``ToolInput``, mapped through ``from_tool_input``, and driven through
  ``astream`` — the SAME field-combine → validate → map path the tool face applies.
  The SSE framing is identical to the plain run door.

The two list doors are thin adapters over operations in
``tai42_skeleton.operations.agents``; the two run doors are SSE streams
(transport-shaped) that stay handlers. Success bodies are ``{"data": {...}}``;
failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
