"""Prometheus multiprocess directory lifecycle and exposition rendering.

The mcp_app master, the backend worker, and the metrics server form ONE run
family over a single shared multiproc dir (``PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR``) and are
restarted TOGETHER. Ownership of the dir is split so no live worker's mmap files
are yanked mid-run:

- ``wipe_prometheus_multiproc_dir`` — master-only, called once before workers are
  spawned. It clears stale db files from previous runs under an exclusive lock,
  guarded by a per-run sentinel so only the first caller of a run wipes.
- ``init_prometheus_multiproc_dir`` — every reader/worker path; ensures the dir
  exists without wiping, so the metrics server and backend worker never destroy a
  populated dir.

Restart semantics (accepted, not engineered around): restarting the mcp_app
master mid-run re-runs the single wipe while a still-running backend worker holds
its mmap files open, silently orphaning those counters until the family restarts
together. This is the standard prometheus multiproc operating model — the dir is
cleared once at fresh deploy/boot, not per process.
