``/health`` returns a static ``OK`` — pure liveness.

``/ready`` pings exactly the backing stores THIS deployment has wired, reusing
each subsystem's existing gating logic instead of inventing new config. A worker
whose Redis/Postgres is unreachable 500s every real request while ``/health``
stays green; ``/ready`` lets an orchestrator rotate it and a load balancer drain
it. Distinct connections are deduped and pinged once, concurrently, each under a
module-constant timeout budget.
