"""HTTP surface for the internal notifications sink and the send door.

- ``GET /api/notifications`` (AUTHED) — return the deployment's internal
  notifications, newest-first. Each record is
  ``{"id", "message", "recipient", "audience", "created_at"}``. A restricted caller
  reads its own per-identity feed (only its ``audience``-addressed records); an
  unrestricted caller reads the shared feed.
- ``POST /api/notifications`` (AUTHED) — send a human a one-way, fire-and-forget
  notification: on a named ``channel``, or (channel omitted) recorded to the
  internal sink. A blank message / unknown channel / blank recipient / blank
  audience is a loud 400, a channel that cannot notify a 501, and a delivery
  failure a 502.

Both doors are thin adapters over operations in
``tai42_skeleton.operations.notifications``. Success bodies are ``{"data": ...}``;
failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
