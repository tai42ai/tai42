"""HTTP surface for the channels feature — the authed catalog door the Studio
admin surface consumes.

- ``GET /api/channels`` (AUTHED) — list the registered channel names, i.e. the
  delivery media ``ask_user(channel=...)`` can currently resolve. Registration
  itself is import-only (a manifest ``channel_modules`` entry); this door is
  read-only. Success bodies are ``{"data": ...}``.

The route is a thin adapter over the :func:`list_channels` operation; the
operation logic lives in ``tai42_skeleton.operations.channels``.
