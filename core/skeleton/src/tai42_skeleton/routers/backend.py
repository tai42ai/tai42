"""HTTP surface for backend identity + the fleet doors (all AUTHED).

- ``GET /api/backend`` — backend identity (or ``present: false``, 200, so the UI
  can render the empty state without treating it as an error).
- ``GET /api/fleet/workers`` — the live worker fleet from the bus presence census.
- ``POST /api/fleet/reload-config`` — soft-restart all (or ``targets``) workers.

``list_workers`` carries no try/except: a presence-store failure must surface as a
500, never an empty ``[]``. The reload door applies locally then broadcasts and
embeds the per-origin fleet report; a failed LOCAL apply re-surfaces as a 500 with
the report attached, while a sibling that fails/goes missing is reported in the
embedded fleet report (and logged), never raised.

All three doors are thin adapters over operations in
``tai42_skeleton.operations.backend``. The reload ``targets`` list is a body input the
route validates itself with typed 400s, so it is parsed here at the HTTP edge
rather than by the adapter's plain request-model parse. Success bodies are
``{"data": ...}``; failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
