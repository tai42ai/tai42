"""HTTP surface for the conversation-route management feature — the authed CRUD doors
the operator and Studio drive over the routing table.

- ``GET /api/conversations`` (AUTHED) — list the stored routes, each with its
  ``callback_secret`` withheld.
- ``GET /api/conversations/{route_name}`` (AUTHED) — read one route by name; an unknown
  name is a loud 404.
- ``POST /api/conversations/{route_name}`` (AUTHED, ``authority_changing``) — create or
  replace a route from a ``ConversationRouteCreate`` body. An ``api`` row's minted
  ``callback_secret`` is returned ONCE here and never again. Binding the route's
  ``execution_key`` is a pass-role decision the operation takes before any write.
- ``DELETE /api/conversations/{route_name}`` (AUTHED) — delete a route by name; an
  unknown name is a loud 404.

Thin adapters over ``tai42_skeleton.operations.conversations`` — no routing logic here.
The POST body is structurally validated at the edge (a strict 400 surface); the operation
owns the logical guards. The channel door (``accept`` / ``record_delivery_status``) lives
on the ``conversations`` facet, not here.
