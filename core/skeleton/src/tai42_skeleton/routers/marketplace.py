"""The marketplace HTTP surface — ``/api/marketplace/*`` (all AUTHED).

Ten thin adapters over the operations in
``tai42_skeleton.operations.marketplace``:

* ``GET  /api/marketplace/search``                 — proxy the registry search (multi-value ``tags``).
* ``GET  /api/marketplace/plugins/{ns}/{name}``    — one listing's detail composed with its versions.
* ``GET  /api/marketplace/categories``             — the controlled category vocabulary.
* ``GET  /api/marketplace/kinds``                  — the controlled item-kind vocabulary.
* ``GET  /api/marketplace/installed``              — the installed inventory (per-row compat + update
  availability) and the boot's plugin-quarantine entries.
* ``POST /api/marketplace/install``                — install a plugin by ref.
* ``POST /api/marketplace/uninstall``              — uninstall a plugin by ref.
* ``POST /api/marketplace/update``                 — update a plugin to a newer/named version.
* ``POST /api/marketplace/upgrade-all``            — upgrade every installed plugin to its latest
  compatible version (a per-ref report, never a batch abort).
* ``GET  /api/marketplace/advisories``             — the cached advisory snapshot for installed plugins.

Success bodies are ``{"data": ...}``; failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.

Security model: install/uninstall/update/upgrade-all mutate the running
environment by design
(they run arbitrary third-party code) and are scope-guardable through the existing
scopes mechanism like any other route; the operations also carry
``authority_changing`` so they are off the default projected MCP tool surface. The
registry is reached OUTBOUND only — this is a server-side proxy, so Studio needs no
second origin. A registry that cannot be reached or answers garbage is a failed
UPSTREAM dependency of this proxying surface, so it maps to a 502 Bad Gateway (a
500 would blame this server; a 503 would falsely promise that a retry fixes it) —
the translation lives in the operations layer.

The advisory poll is the ONE background outbound call the feature makes and is a
documented, default-on setting (``MARKETPLACE_ADVISORIES_POLL``); its lifecycle is
wired at the bottom of this module, so the poll runs exactly when this surface is
opted into the deployment's ``routers_modules``.

The search route reads its whitelisted query facets at the HTTP edge (``tags`` is
multi-value and must survive as repeated params, which the adapter's plain
query-param parse would collapse), so it uses a context extractor; the other reads
take path params or none, and the three writes parse their small JSON body through
the adapter's request-model parse.
