"""HTTP routes for the sub-MCP app registry — ``/api/sub-mcp*``.

Three AUTHED doors over the DURABLE sub-MCP registration store, which the live
``tai42_app.sub_app.mcp_sub_app_router`` caches per worker:

* ``GET /api/sub-mcp`` — the registered sub-MCP routes as a JSON-safe view,
  ``{slug: {"tools": [...], "transport": "..."}}``, read from the store so the list
  is coherent across workers (not just this worker's in-process cache).
* ``POST /api/sub-mcp`` — register (or reload) a sub-MCP app exposing ``tools``
  under ``slug`` on an optional ``transport`` (``http`` default). ``slug`` +
  ``tools`` are required; a malformed slug, an unknown tool, or a bad transport is
  rejected before registration (400, or 404 for an unknown tool). The write goes
  through the store-first service, so the registration is durable before the
  in-process router swap.
* ``DELETE /api/sub-mcp/{slug}`` — unregister a sub-MCP app and tear down its
  ASGI lifespan. A slug present in NEITHER the store NOR this worker's router is a
  loud 404; a slug registered on a sibling worker is store-only here and is still
  deletable from any worker.

All three doors are thin adapters over operations in
``tai42_skeleton.operations.sub_mcp`` — no routing/build logic lives here. The POST
body's structural shape (slug pattern, transport, tool-name types) is validated
here at the HTTP edge with typed 400s (producing the operation's flat arguments)
rather than by the adapter's plain request-model parse. Success bodies are
``{"data": ...}``; failures are ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
