"""Redis-cached, Postgres-durable concrete :class:`ConnectorTokenStore`.

Postgres (table ``connector_connections``, defined in the skeleton init SQL) is
the durable source of truth; Redis is a hot cache in front of it so a large
fleet never opens a Postgres connection per request. ``get`` reads Redis first
and falls back to Postgres on a miss (repopulating the cache); ``put`` commits
to Postgres and then refreshes Redis.

Single-namespace: each deployment owns its store, so ``connection_id`` (a uuid4)
is globally unique on its own and keys every record — Redis key ``rec:{cid}``,
Postgres primary key ``(connection_id)``.

The store treats the blob as opaque ciphertext — the AES-GCM boundary lives at
``tai42_skeleton.connectors.oauth.crypto``. Both Redis and Postgres hold
ciphertext only.

Cache coherence is fenced by a per-row monotonic ``cache_version``: every
durable write bumps it and returns the new value, and the Redis record carries
it alongside the blob. Both the ``put`` cache refresh and the cache-miss
read-populate apply their write ONLY when the incoming version is newer than the
cached one (an atomic set-if-newer in Lua). A reader that loaded an old snapshot
from Postgres therefore can never overwrite a newer entry a concurrent writer
already installed — the cache can never regress to a value older than the latest
durable write, so it never serves an expired token past a completed refresh. A
delete is the latest durable write too: it leaves a version-fenced tombstone (a
version-only marker, no blob) at the deleted version, so a read-populate that
loaded the row just before the delete cannot resurrect it into the cache.

If a cache write itself fails after the durable commit, a stale prior entry may
still sit in Redis; the store then deletes the key so the next read repopulates
from Postgres, and if that delete also fails it logs LOUDLY (the record could be
served stale until its ``session_expires_at`` TTL elapses).

``provider_id`` and ``alias`` are persisted as plaintext columns purely to back
the ``UNIQUE (provider_id, alias)`` constraint. Every insert path — a create-only
insert or a plain upsert — writes them, so an upsert overwrites the stored
identity to match the incoming one; either path that collides on the constraint
(a second connection claiming an ``(provider_id, alias)`` a different connection
already holds) raises :class:`AliasInUseError` (the durable authority for
per-provider alias uniqueness).

``session_expires_at`` (supplied by the caller, who can read the decrypted
record) is persisted as a column and is the durable dead-session bound: ``get``
and ``list`` read only rows whose ``session_expires_at`` is null or still in the
future, so a connection idle past its session/refresh-token death stops serving
even from Postgres. The same column drives the Redis ``EXPIREAT`` so the cache
evicts around the same time; a cache-miss repopulates with the remaining lifetime
read back from Postgres.

Both backends are reached through the app-pooled ``PostgresClient`` /
``RedisClient`` so the connection pools are shared (same-DSN callers — token /
catalog / sources stores — share one Postgres pool) and closed centrally at app
shutdown.
