"""Redact connector secrets from MCP request logs via the log-record factory.

Managed calls put secrets into the request struct: the OAuth access token via
the JSON-RPC ``_meta`` field (stdio) or an ``Authorization`` header (http), and a
no-auth connection's client config into the ``headers`` (http) or ``env`` (stdio)
of the transport config. No local logger surfaces these under normal config, but
a DEBUG bump of ``mcp.shared.session``, a future fastmcp release, or a wrapper
layer could.

Redaction rides ``logging.setLogRecordFactory``: every ``LogRecord`` the process
creates passes through a wrapping factory that masks the ``_meta`` token value
and every value inside a logged ``headers``/``env`` object — in the message, and
in any attached exception/stack text. Because the record is scrubbed at creation,
before any handler sees it, every in-scope downstream sink emits the redacted text
no matter how logging is configured: named uvicorn loggers, late-added handlers,
``propagate=False`` loggers with their own handler, and even
``logging.lastResort`` (the stderr fallback used when a record reaches no
handler). A cheap substring guard keeps a token-free record almost free — no
``%``-formatting and no exception rendering unless a marker is actually present.

The wrapper applies to a scope, so an embedded tai app does not scrub a host's
own log records:

* ``scope="tai"`` (the default, installed from ``build_app``): only records the
  tai runtime's operation feeds are scrubbed — the tai logger family (the module
  ``__name__`` of a tai package: ``tai42_skeleton``, ``tai42_kit``, ``tai42_contract``,
  ``tai42_backend_*``, ``tai42_connector_*``, …, or a dotted child of one) plus the
  ``mcp`` / ``fastmcp`` library trees the runtime drives. A host app's own
  records pass through untouched.
* ``scope="process"`` (installed from the CLI entrypoints, which own their
  process): every record in the process is scrubbed.

The scope only ever widens: a ``scope="process"`` install upgrades the predicate
even over an already-installed wrapper, and a later ``scope="tai"`` install never
narrows it back.
