"""Per-connection Redis lock used by the resolver and the service layer.

One short ``SET NX PX`` lock per connection serialises every read-modify-write
of a connection record across replicas. Use it as::

    async with connection_lock(connection_id):
        <read record, mutate, store.put>

The lock is best-effort: if Redis is unreachable or the wait times out, the
context manager logs a WARNING and proceeds WITHOUT the lock so a Redis outage
never wedges token refresh. That degradation is visible (WARNING), never silent.

Redis is reached through the app-pooled ``RedisClient`` (closed centrally at
shutdown).
