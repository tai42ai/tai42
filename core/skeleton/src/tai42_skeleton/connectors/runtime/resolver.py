"""Runtime token resolution for connector-managed manifest entries.

Returns a :class:`ManagedAuth` (a bearer access token) for every outbound MCP
call against a managed entry, refreshing proactively before expiry or reactively
(via :func:`force_refresh`) after an upstream 401.

Cross-replica safety comes from the per-connection Redis lock plus a
compare-and-set write-back: the hot path reads the record and serves a
still-fresh token without locking; any read-modify-write of the record happens
under :func:`connection_lock`, so N replicas racing a just-expired token
serialise into one upstream refresh. A refresh can outlive the lock's TTL (the
transient-retry budget), so the write-back is keyed on the ciphertext the refresh
began with via ``store.put(expected_blob=...)``: if a peer rotated the stored
record meanwhile, our compare-and-set loses and we serve the peer's record rather
than clobber it. The store decides the race atomically — there is no
re-read-then-write window.

Failure modes map to typed exceptions the caller (the MCP request handler)
translates into tool errors:

- :class:`ConnectorReconnectRequiredError` — provider returned ``invalid_grant``;
  the user must reconnect.
- :class:`ConnectorRefreshFailingError` — the bounded retry budget on transient
  errors was exhausted; the connection flips to ``REFRESH_FAILING``.
- :class:`ConnectorConnectionError` — the connection is missing (base class).
