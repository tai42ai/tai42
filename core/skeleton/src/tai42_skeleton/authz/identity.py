"""The caller-identity model for the tool-edge authorization check.

The identity is RESOLVED AT EXECUTION from the request-user context the access
control middleware binds (:func:`get_current_user_id`). The tool-edge
``AuthzMiddleware`` fires only on the MCP-serving transport — an EXTERNAL surface
— so a call reaching it with no resolvable identity (while access control is
enabled) is denied fail-closed. Internal dispatch (agents resolving tools,
schedulers, backend workers) never passes through that middleware; the internal
principal exists for the rare direct programmatic check that must be allowed.

    ``user_id`` is the authenticated caller (``None`` = no resolvable identity).
    ``is_internal`` marks the platform-internal principal, which is always
    allowed (behavior preservation for agents/schedulers/workers).

    ``effective_scopes`` is the HTTP auth backend's already-decided scope set for
    this caller (owner-attenuated for an owned/delegated key), carried from the
    guard middleware so the tool-edge check enforces the SAME scopes the HTTP edge
    did rather than re-deriving an owned key's unattenuated policy scopes. ``None``
    means no attenuation decision was carried — the check then falls back to the
    caller's own policy scopes, which for a non-owned key ARE the effective scopes.
    An authenticated request always carries it (the guard binds it with the id); a
    background fire carries NONE, so the check re-derives that fire's attenuation live
    from the key's and the owner's current policies at every dispatch.

    ``claims`` on an authenticated request is the caller's verified token claims,
    carried from the same guard binding, so the tool-edge check builds its jq context
    with the SAME ``.identity.*`` the HTTP backend uses AND reads the owner reference
    (under ``OWNER_USER_ID_CLAIM``) that drives the owner second-pass enforce. A
    background fire presents no token and carries a SYNTHETIC claim set from the key's
    stored ``policy_data`` — the owner reference alone, or ``{}`` when ownerless.
    ``None`` means no caller was bound (read as an empty identity) or a gate-off fire.

    ``execution_key_fingerprint`` is set ONLY on a fire's synthetic identity: the per-mint
    key identity the firing record captured at bind, carried so a capability dispatch's
    mid-turn liveness re-read asserts the SAME equality. NEVER a jq-context claim, so it
    stays out of the ``.identity.*`` a condition sees. ``None`` otherwise.
