"""The author-facing ``notify_user`` surface — one fire-and-forget message to a
human, no reply expected.

Unlike ``ask_user`` there is no interaction, no ticket, no callback and no
blocking wait: the named channel sends the message and the call returns as soon
as the medium accepts it ("sent" means accepted by the medium, not seen by a
human). One send attempt, no retry; every failure raises loudly
(``ChannelDeliveryError`` from the channel, ``NotImplementedError`` from a
channel that cannot notify).

``channel`` is optional: with a named channel the message is delivered on that
medium; with ``channel=None`` it is recorded to the internal notifications sink
(the Studio inbox reads it back), so nothing is ever silently dropped.

``audience`` is the IDENTITY (a user_id) whose in-app inbox shows the
message — distinct from ``recipient`` (a channel delivery address). It is honored
even when a channel is set: an ``audience``-addressed call records the in-app entry
(shared + per-identity feed) REGARDLESS of whether a channel also delivers it, so
``notify_user(channel="sms", recipient=…, audience=A)`` both pushes to SMS AND lands
in A's in-app feed (matching ``ask_user``, which always persists). An UNRESTRICTED
caller's channel send with no audience stores nothing; a RESTRICTED caller's audience
is clamped to its OWN identity, so its channel send ALWAYS records to its own feed too
(in addition to the channel push) — a channel send storing nothing is the unrestricted-caller
case only.

    """Notify a human of ``message``, fire-and-forget.

    With a named ``channel`` the message is sent on that medium and the list of
    per-message ids the medium assigned the send is returned — the ids an out-of-band
    delivery receipt is later correlated back against; a return means the medium
    ACCEPTED it, not that a human saw it. One send attempt, no retry, no reply.

    With ``channel=None`` the message is recorded to the internal notifications
    sink (Redis), which the Studio inbox reads back (returning an empty id list — an
    internal record has no medium-assigned id); the interactions Redis must be
    reachable or the write raises loudly (never a silent no-op).

    ``recipient`` is an OPTIONAL per-call address (chat id, phone number, ...).
    On a named channel it is carried to the channel, which validates it against
    its operator allowlist; omitted, the channel sends to its operator-configured
    default recipient. With ``channel=None`` it is stored verbatim on the sink
    record. A set value must be a non-blank string.

    ``audience`` is the IDENTITY (a user_id) whose in-app inbox shows this,
    distinct from ``recipient``. When set, the in-app record is written (shared +
    per-identity feed) REGARDLESS of whether a channel also delivers the message —
    so an addressed notification lands in the identity's feed even on the channel
    path. A blank value is rejected.

    ``media`` and ``template`` are OPTIONAL richer-send forms threaded onto the
    ``ChannelNotification`` the channel receives (the contract enforces they are
    mutually exclusive). Both REQUIRE a named channel: the internal sink stores only
    message/recipient/audience, so either supplied with ``channel=None`` is a loud
    ``ValueError`` (a client error the operation door maps to a 400), never a silent
    drop. A channel advertises support with the OPTIONAL class attributes
    ``supports_media_notifications`` / ``supports_template_notifications`` (absent =
    unsupported); the matching field sent to a channel that does not advertise it is a
    ``NotImplementedError`` (the operation door maps it to a 501) — a sibling channel
    that reads only ``notification.message`` must never accept the send while the
    extra content silently vanishes. The guard fires BEFORE the in-app feed record, so
    a refused send leaves no phantom feed entry.

    The notification carries no ``sender_identity`` — that field is the conversation
    bridge's — so the channel sends from its own configured identity.

    Raises ``ValueError`` for a blank message, an unknown channel name, a blank
    ``recipient``/``audience``, or ``media``/``template`` with no named channel;
    ``CrossIdentityAudienceError`` when a restricted caller addresses another identity
    (a cross-identity authorization denial the operation door maps to a 403);
    ``NotImplementedError`` when a channel cannot notify or does not advertise the
    ``media``/``template`` capability; ``ChannelDeliveryError`` when a channel send
    fails. Every failure propagates loudly — nothing is swallowed.
