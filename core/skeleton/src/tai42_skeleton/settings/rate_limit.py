"""``TAI_RATE_LIMIT_*`` config for the app-level public-door rate limiter.

The limiter is an app middleware applied to the three PUBLIC door families —
the interactions callback route, ``universal_webhook/*``, and the trigger-link
door ``/trigger/{token}`` — leaving authed routes untouched (the credential is the
gate there). Each family has its own per-minute limit + 10-second burst and an
enable switch, so a flood on one door cannot exhaust another's budget. Settings are
read at call time.
