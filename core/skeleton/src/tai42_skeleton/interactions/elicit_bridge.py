"""Bridge FastMCP elicitation onto the interactions ``ask_user`` channel.

A tool's ``ctx.elicit()`` normally resolves only when the calling client
supports elicitation; an in-process caller (agent, webhook-triggered run,
scheduled backend) has no client to answer, so the call dead-ends. This bridge
routes such an elicit through the SAME human-in-the-loop waiter/store as
``ask_user`` (the interactions system), so a human answers on any interactions
channel and the typed result flows back to the caller.

The skeleton's in-process Context-injection layer (the ``run_tool`` path) drives
this: the in-process bridge context (see
:mod:`tai42_skeleton.tools.context_bridge`) routes ``ctx.elicit`` through
:func:`resolve_elicit`, which DERIVES the schema from the ``response_type`` (a
Python type) via ``parse_elicit_response_type`` and carries it as the form
answer-schema.

Accept-or-raise: a validated form answer maps to ``AcceptedElicitation``; a
timeout / no-answer RAISES (the no-answerable-path invariant). The bridge never
rounds a decline or cancel through ``ask_user`` — an unanswerable elicit is a
loud error, never a silent default.
