"""The author-facing ``ask_user`` surface — the ``AskUser`` contract impl.

Engine-agnostic: it reads no flow/engine context and depends on nothing the
engine threads. Each call generates its own ``interaction_id`` and an optional
caller ``group_id`` (uuid4 when absent), persists the question to Redis, then
blocks on a per-interaction reply channel until the answer returns or the
timeout budget elapses (loud ``InteractionTimeoutError`` — never a silent default).

The ``external`` answer format acts on an EXTERNAL surface (sign, approve, pay):
the caller blocks exactly as for any other format while the external system
delivers the answer through a public callback door. ``link`` supplies that
surface — a template carrying ``{callback_url}`` or a callable that builds the
external resource from the callback URL and returns its final URL.

    Returns the typed answer per ``answer_format`` (text->str, confirm->bool,
    select->chosen value, form->validated dict, external->the callback payload).
    Raises ``InteractionTimeoutError`` on expiry, ``InteractionLimitError`` when
    the ``max_concurrent`` guard trips, ``ValueError`` for a bad format/argument
    combination or a blank ``audience``, ``CrossIdentityAudienceError`` when a
    RESTRICTED caller addresses another identity (a loud cross-identity authorization
    denial), and ``RuntimeError`` when an external question is asked without
    ``INTERACTIONS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL``. Invalid ``media`` raises
    ``pydantic.ValidationError`` when the ``InteractionRequest`` is built, before
    any state is written.

    ``link`` is required for ``answer_format="external"`` (unless a ``channel``
    delivers the question) and forbidden otherwise.

    ``verifier`` (``{"name", "config"}``) binds a registered webhook verifier to
    the external callback so the signed server-to-server answer is authenticated
    before it is recorded; it is only valid with ``answer_format="external"`` (a
    verifier is meaningless without the external callback route). It is stashed
    server-side in the ``format_payload`` and stripped from the client frame.

    ``sensitive`` marks the answer body as not-to-be-persisted: the caller still
    receives the full answer, but the durable answered record keeps only the
    status (no response body). Use it for credentials or personal data.

    ``channel`` names a registered channel that delivers the question to a human
    on an external medium; ``None`` keeps the default Studio-inbox-only surface.
    A set channel forces the ticket + callback-URL mint for EVERY answer format
    (the channel bridges the reply back through the public callback door),
    forbids ``link`` and ``verifier`` (the channel owns delivery, and its
    forward is unsigned), and rejects ``answer_format="form"`` (a multi-field
    form has no single-reply mapping on a chat/SMS medium). An unknown name
    raises ``ValueError`` before any state is written. A failed delivery prunes
    the question and re-raises (``ChannelDeliveryError`` for a delivery
    failure, including a deliver call that does not return within the ask's
    timeout budget) — unless the reply already landed first, in which case the
    recorded answer is returned.

    ``recipient`` is an OPTIONAL per-call address (chat id, phone number, ...)
    carried to the named channel, which validates it against its operator
    allowlist — an unlisted address makes the delivery fail loudly; omitted,
    the channel sends to its operator-configured default recipient. Nothing is
    resolved or validated here beyond presence and non-emptiness (a set value
    must be a non-blank string): the plugin owns the allowlist. ``recipient``
    is forbidden when ``channel`` is ``None`` (an address is meaningless
    without a channel to send on).

    ``audience`` is the identity (a user_id) the question is addressed to:
    a restricted identity sees and answers ONLY questions addressed to it, while an
    unrestricted operator sees and may answer everything. Leave it unset for an
    operator/broadcast question. It is the isolation axis — a WHO, distinct from
    ``recipient`` (a channel delivery address — a WHERE) — and the two may be set
    together (address the question to identity A AND deliver it over a channel).

    ``media`` is optional display-only content rendered WITH the question in the
    Studio inbox — a list of ``MediaItem`` (or their dict form) each
    ``{"kind": "image"|"link", "url", "caption"?}``. An ``image`` url is an
    absolute ``https`` URL or a ``data:image/*`` URI; a ``link`` url is an
    absolute ``http(s)`` URL; ``caption`` is the image alt text / link label. At
    most eight items, within a per-question total URI budget. It never becomes
    part of the answer — the human still answers via ``answer_format`` — and it is
    NOT forwarded to channel deliveries: a channel receives the question text
    only, while the inbox is where the media renders.
