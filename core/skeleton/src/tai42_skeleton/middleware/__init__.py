"""App-level ASGI middleware that ships with the skeleton.

``RateLimitMiddleware`` (the public-door flood limiter) is registered at app
construction and is always on; it derives its coverage from the route registry, so
every route registered ``authed=False`` is throttled — tune or disable a door
family's budget via ``TAI_RATE_LIMIT_*``. ``AuditLogMiddleware`` (the
one-line-per-request audit trail) and ``BodyLimitMiddleware`` (the body-size cap)
are registered on the base app, INSIDE the access-control gate, so the audit line
carries the identity the gate resolved; the audit trail is on by default and
``TAI_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLE=false`` leaves it unregistered. A manifest
``middlewares_modules`` entry is the opt-in path for OTHER middleware you add;
importing such a module fires its ``@tai42_app.http.middleware`` registration.
