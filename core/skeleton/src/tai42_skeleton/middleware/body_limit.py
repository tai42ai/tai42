"""App-level request body-size cap — the backstop on every route.

Public doors read their bodies bounded already (a 64 KiB-class cap); the AUTHED
routes read the whole body unbounded (``request.json()`` and friends). This
middleware caps EVERY route in one place: the running total of the ACTUAL body
bytes read is bounded (never a client-declared ``Content-Length``, which is
advisory), and an over-cap request is answered with 413, loudly — never a
silently truncated stream.

The escape signal is a module-private ``_BodyTooLarge`` that subclasses
``Exception`` DIRECTLY, never ``ValueError``: several routes wrap
``request.json()`` in ``except ValueError`` (``routers/backup.py``,
``routers/_tool_call.py``), so a ``ValueError``-based escape would be swallowed
into a 400 and the 413 would never fire. Raised from the wrapped ``receive`` and
caught around the inner app: before response-start it is converted to a 413,
after start it is re-raised (the stream cannot be un-sent).

This runs INSIDE the base app's own Starlette stack (via the base-app middleware
list, so it sits inside that app's ``ServerErrorMiddleware``): the over-cap escape
must reach this handler and become a 413 before any error middleware turns the
raised ``_BodyTooLarge`` into a 500. Always on; tune via
``TAI_BODY_LIMIT_MAX_BODY_BYTES``.
