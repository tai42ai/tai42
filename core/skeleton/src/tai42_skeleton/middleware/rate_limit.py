"""App-level rate limiter for the three PUBLIC door families.

Applied ONLY to ``/universal_webhook/*`` (the fully public hooks ingress),
``/api/interactions/callback/*`` (the ticket-gated interactions callback), and
``/trigger/*`` (the trigger-link door, which executes tools per GET). Every other
path — including all authed routes — passes straight through: the credential is
the gate there. Each family has its own per-minute limit + a 10-second burst
window and an enable switch, so a flood on one public door cannot exhaust
another's budget.

Keying and window semantics: a fixed-window Redis counter per client bucket,
INCR + EXPIRE issued in one pipeline (a pipeline cannot branch on INCR's result;
re-setting the TTL every hit is harmless), key TTL = 2x the window. The client
bucket collapses an IPv6 address to its /64; X-Forwarded-For is honoured only
when the direct peer is a configured trusted proxy.

The app registers this middleware at construction, so both public doors are
rate-limited by default — a public door is exposed by design and must not ship
without its flood control. Each family can still be tuned or turned off via its
``TAI_RATE_LIMIT_*`` enable/limit settings (both enabled by default).
