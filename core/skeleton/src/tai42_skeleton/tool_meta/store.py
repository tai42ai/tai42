"""The concrete :class:`~tai42_contract.tool_meta.ToolMetaStore` — two plain
Postgres tables behind the folder + overlay contract.

``tool_folders`` is a tree of real folder entities; ``tool_meta`` is a per-tool
overlay row keyed by tool name. Postgres is reached through the app-pooled
``PostgresClient`` (module-level ``client_ctx`` import so tests can monkeypatch the
seam), sharing one pool per DSN with the other durable stores. Each mutation runs
inside one ``conn.transaction()`` so a multi-statement change (the clean-slate
delete-then-re-key on :meth:`rename_tool`, the delete-dest before an upsert claim)
commits or rolls back as a unit.

Invariants the tables cannot express are enforced here:

* **cycle-freedom** — a folder may never become its own ancestor. Move/create
  walks the parent chain and raises :class:`FolderCycleError` on a loop.
* **empty-folder delete** — a folder is deletable only when it holds no subfolders
  AND no overlay rows, else :class:`FolderNotEmptyError`.
* **clean-slate name reclaim** — a dangling overlay row survives a plugin uninstall
  and could collide with a name a DIFFERENT tool later claims; :meth:`rename_tool`
  deletes any pre-existing destination row before re-keying, so a freed name never
  inherits a ghost's overlay.

Idempotency exception to the raise-loudly rule: :meth:`delete_meta` and
:meth:`rename_tool` are NO-OPS when the tool owns no row — both run on EVERY preset
delete/rename and most tools never own a row. Every other failure (folder absent,
not empty, cycle, sibling-name conflict) raises loudly.
