"""The worker bus — the app's one INTERNAL fleet fan-out primitive.

Every process (HTTP server or backend runtime) that shares a manifest joins one
Redis pub/sub control channel through :meth:`WorkerBus.subscribe` and keeps a TTL
presence key alive; a mutation reaches the whole fleet through the single awaited
:meth:`WorkerBus.publish`, which collects a per-origin outcome from every live
worker.

This is app-owned internal infrastructure, like the reload gate — NOT a plugin.
Nothing here is registrable, swappable, or user-selectable; there is exactly one
bus, and no manifest field chooses an implementation. A deployment with no Redis
configured runs on :meth:`WorkerBus.local`, the no-op variant.

Namespacing
-----------
``TAI_BUS_NAMESPACE`` (default ``tai``) prefixes the control channel, every reply
channel, and the presence keys. Redis pub/sub is server-global (NOT scoped by db
index), so two deployments/stacks sharing one Redis MUST diverge by namespace or
they would cross-talk; a shared-Redis deployment sets a unique namespace per stack.

Transport shape
---------------
One control channel carries every op; each op names an ephemeral reply channel
for its confirmations. The census is a scan of the per-origin presence keys — the
registered origins ARE the fleet listing. Two wire messages come back from a
subscriber per op: a ``received`` ack the instant the op is delivered (the fast
liveness signal) and exactly one terminal ``applied``/``failed`` once the op has
fully applied (the slow correctness signal). ``timed_out`` and ``departed`` are
never wire replies — the publisher computes them from the presence census at the
report cut.

Fork safety
-----------
A forked child (an rq work-horse per job, a celery prefork pool child per task)
inherits the parent's :class:`WorkerBus` object across ``os.fork()`` — its origin
included. The bus registers an ``os.register_at_fork`` after-in-child hook at
construction that re-mints the child's copy of the origin to a fresh same-kind
value, so a fleet op the child publishes is applied by the parent instead of being
echo-skipped as the parent's own broadcast. The child remains a non-member: its
inherited subscription task is dormant and it registers no presence, so the re-mint
neither resumes a subscription nor advertises a second census identity.

Missing vs departed
-------------------
``census()`` and the expected-origin set cover REGISTERED origins only; a
mid-reconnect worker is intentionally absent and self-heals (its startup re-reads
persisted state) before rejoining. An expected origin that never sends its
``received`` ack is re-checked against presence: the key still live ⇒ ``missing``
(alive but silent, only reachable inside the short ack window); the key expired ⇒
``departed`` (the worker went away). An origin that acked but never sent a terminal
by the apply deadline is re-checked the same way: expired ⇒ ``departed`` (ack then
die — SIGKILL / rolling restart mid-reload), alive ⇒ ``timed_out`` (the op WAS
delivered and usually still applies when its reload gate frees; verify with the
fleet census or a fleet reload).
