"""The app's client surface — a thin delegate over the tai42-kit pooled-client framework.

Surfaces the pooling on the app: ``client_ctx(SomeClient, settings=…, fresh=…)``
yields a connected client, pooled per event loop + connection params (or a one-shot
off-pool client when ``fresh=True``); ``shutdown_clients()`` closes every live pool
for the running loop at teardown. The pooling itself lives in ``tai42_kit.clients`` —
this only exposes it on the app, so callers reach a client by class and never import
a concrete client here.
