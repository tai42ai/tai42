"""Active-MCP-session registry and the ``list_changed`` broadcast primitive.

FastMCP (3.4.2) exposes NO "notify all connected sessions" helper and NO
``on_disconnect`` hook: its only list-changed emit paths are per-session
(``session.send_tool_list_changed()`` and friends). A manifest reload runs
OUTSIDE any session, so there is nothing to call — the broadcast machinery is
net-new skeleton infrastructure built here on top of the per-session emit.

The registry captures live sessions through :class:`SessionTrackingMiddleware`
(which sees every incoming message) and holds them WEAKLY, so a collected
session drops out on its own; it additionally prunes any session whose send
raises. Membership is thus self-healing and never depends on a disconnect
callback that does not exist.
