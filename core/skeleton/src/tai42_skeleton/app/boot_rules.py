"""Boot-time worker-bus invariants — refuse to start a deployment that needs the
bus but has none configured.

The worker bus is what keeps sibling workers from serving stale config after a
reload, so three shapes require ``TAI_BUS_REDIS_URL``:

* more than one server worker (siblings would diverge on a reload),
* a task backend registered in the manifest (the backend-runtime and server
  processes must converge), and
* ``TAI_CONFIG_MODE=k8s`` (multi-pod shared config — the replica count is
  undetectable from inside one pod).

A single-worker, file-mode process with no backend is the supported busless shape
and runs on :meth:`WorkerBus.local`.

The k8s and workers checks read only boot-fixed env / args, so they run at the CLI
BEFORE the config manager is constructed — a busless k8s boot then refuses naming
``TAI_BUS_REDIS_URL`` rather than failing first on a kubeconfig connection. The
backend check needs the manifest, so it also runs at the ``app_context`` seam that
both ``tai serve`` and ``tai backend`` cross, and re-runs there on every reload.
