    ``cli.metrics.create_app`` — construction is deferred out of import time.

    catalog refresh as a startup+reload handler; later calls return the same app.
    The catalog loads the in-memory provider cache at MCP startup AND after every
    in-place re-init (``update()`` drops process state, and a community add
