"""``TAI_SAMPLING_*`` config for the platform-LLM sampling fallback budgets.

Co-located with the sampling bridge: a per-call token ceiling (the default
applied when a caller passes no ``max_tokens``; an over-ask is refused loudly,
never silently clamped) and a per-invocation ceiling on how many ``ctx.sample()``
calls one in-process tool invocation may make through the bridge. Read at call
time through the ``settings_cache`` accessor.
