"""Tool-surface operations — ``/api/tools*`` and ``/api/run-tool``, plus the live
app-management tools (run, reload, and remove a tool).

Reads:

* ``list_tools`` — the sorted registered tool names.
* ``tool_tags`` — the per-tool native-``tags`` map plus plugin-declared visibility.
* ``tool_schema`` — one tool's input/output/description (unknown name → 404).
* ``tools_schema`` — the same schema view for every tool, keyed by name.

Mutations:

* ``run_tool`` — execute an arbitrary registered tool with REAL side effects, on THIS
  worker only. A "run any tool by name" META-EXECUTOR: hardcode-blocked from the MCP
  surface (``meta_executor=True``, tier 1) and admin-fenced at the HTTP edge; it is
  reachable only as the route + ``tai tools run`` CLI + internal dispatch. Its argument
  is ``tool_name`` (the route's request-model shape).
* ``reload_tool`` — re-register one app tool from its stored definition.
* ``remove_tool`` — remove one app tool from the live registry.

``reload_tool`` / ``remove_tool`` mutate the live registry, so each is applied on this
worker and then broadcast to the fleet over the bus. All three are ``destructive`` and
honor the reload gate.

What each ``run_tool`` branch records: the two 500 branches — an
:class:`~tai42_skeleton.tools.binding.UnknownToolError` naming a DIFFERENT tool than the
one asked for (a dispatch failure inside the running tool's own body) and any other
raise during execution — emit ``logger.exception`` (ERROR, with the caught exception's
traceback); the latter falls back to the exception's CLASS name when the message is
empty, so the envelope always names something. The 404 for a tool that resolved at
lookup and then did not resolve at dispatch emits a ``logger.warning``, so an anomaly
answered as a plain 404 still leaves a server record. Three branches are silent: the 404
for a name that never resolved at all (a caller's own typo, which the response answers),
the typed-``OperationError`` passthrough (the tool's own answer, delivered to the caller
intact), and a RESOLVE that fails for anything OTHER than an unknown tool — that raise
leaves the door untouched, neither enveloped nor logged, so a registry that cannot answer
surfaces as itself.
