"""Checkpoint retention — the sweep that expires idle conversation threads.

``sweep_checkpoints`` deletes every thread whose newest checkpoint is older than
``checkpoint_ttl_minutes`` (the kit ``LLMProviderSettings``). It is the retention
mechanism for the DB-backed providers (``postgres``/``sqlite``); ``redis`` carries
its own native key TTL and ``memory`` is process-lifetime, so both are a no-op
here, as is an unset TTL. Deletion uses the saver's own ``adelete_thread`` surface.

As an operation it projects as a tool, so it is runnable by name through
``/api/schedules``. Native recurrence additionally needs a ``schedule_task``-branched
vehicle (a deployment manifest wraps the tool with the backend's schedule extension);
external cron of ``tai checkpoints sweep`` is the busless alternative.
