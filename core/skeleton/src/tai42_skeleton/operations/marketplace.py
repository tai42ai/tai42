"""Marketplace operations — search, browse, and manage installed plugins.

Ten operations back the ``/api/marketplace/*`` surface: six reads (search the
registry, one listing's detail with its versions, the category vocabulary, the
item-kind vocabulary, the installed inventory with per-row compat/update
availability plus the boot's plugin-quarantine entries, and the advisory
snapshot) and four environment-mutating flows (install, uninstall, update,
upgrade-all) driven by
:class:`~tai42_skeleton.marketplace.installer.Installer`.

The internal :class:`~tai42_skeleton.marketplace.errors.MarketplaceError` family is
load-bearing inside the marketplace package (it carries the not-installed flag,
the pip argv/return code, the two errors of a failed unwind). At THIS boundary
each is translated to the shared operation-error vocabulary
(:func:`_to_operation_error`): a dead or garbled registry is an
:class:`UpstreamError` (502 — this surface proxies the registry, so an upstream
failure is never a this-server 500); an in-progress operation elsewhere in the
fleet is an :class:`UnavailableError` (503, retriable); an unknown listing or a
not-installed ref is a :class:`NotFoundError` (404); a version/collision/contract,
already-installed, or environment-shadowed-prefix conflict is a
:class:`ConflictError` (409); a pip failure,
a github artifact-integrity mismatch, a failed unwind, a manifest-compose fault,
an unknown-item-kind binding drift, or corrupt local
state is an :class:`OperationFailed` (500). A malformed ``ref`` is the caller's
own author error — a typed :class:`~tai42_skeleton.marketplace.errors.MalformedRefError`
the boundary maps to :class:`BadRequestError` (400).

Retry-After limitation: the 503 an in-progress operation answers carries no
``Retry-After`` header. The route adapter stamps static headers on the SUCCESS
response only; an error response is header-less by construction, and the typed
error's ``extra`` dict merges into the JSON body, not the headers. The retriable
signal therefore rides the message and the 503 status, not a header. (The
reload-gate 503 — a separate concern the adapter honors from ``reload_gated``
metadata — DOES carry ``Retry-After: 5``, since that response is built by the
reload gate itself, not the error path.)

install/uninstall/update/upgrade-all mutate the running environment by running
arbitrary third-party code, so each is ``destructive`` and ``authority_changing``
(off the default MCP tool surface — tier 2 — includable only by an explicit
``api_tools.include``) and ``reload_gated`` (the flow ends in a manifest reload,
so the adapter answers a retriable 503 while a reload is in flight).
