"""The ``@operation`` decorator — the single declaration point for an operation.

A decorated function is a plain typed async function; the decorator records its
metadata into the :data:`operation_registry` and stamps the metadata onto the
function object (``__operation__``) so the route adapter can pick it up from the
function alone.
