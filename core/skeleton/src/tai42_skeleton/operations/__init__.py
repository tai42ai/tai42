"""The operations layer — typed async functions + declared metadata.

An operation is a plain async function decorated with :func:`operation`; the
decorator records its metadata into :data:`operation_registry`. Routes are thin
adapters over operations (:func:`register_operation_route`), the OpenAPI spec and
CLI derive from those routes, and the MCP tool surface projects from the registry
(:func:`project_operations`). One source; every management surface derives from it.

    The registry is process-global and a decorator fires exactly once per interpreter,
    so a plain re-import of a router that merely ``from operations.<domain> import <op>``
    never re-registers a leaf that stayed cached in ``sys.modules`` — and the reload
    path clears the registry, so without this the surface would project nothing.

    The FIRST call pops each leaf from ``sys.modules`` and re-imports it (never this
    package or its infra, so the singleton is preserved), re-firing every ``@operation``
    into the cleared registry, then snapshots the registered records. Every LATER call
    re-adds that snapshot without touching ``sys.modules``: the leaf modules are static
    across an in-process reload and the snapshot records are the SAME objects the cached
    leaf functions carry as ``__operation__``, so the routers re-attach their route
    templates to the very records now back in the registry. Avoiding the per-reload
    sys.modules churn keeps the reload off the import machinery's blocking I/O, whose
    yields would otherwise let a reload's synchronous re-import interleave with the
    concurrently-running worker-bus subscription task. A leaf import that fails on the first
    call propagates loudly.
    Runs after ``operation_registry.clear()`` and before the routers re-attach their
    route templates, so the registered metadata is the record the routes decorate and the
    projection reads.
