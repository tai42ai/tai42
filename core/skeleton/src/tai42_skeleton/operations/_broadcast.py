"""The one fleet-broadcast primitive for runtime-op publishers.

Every operation that changes runtime state on this worker AND must reach the rest
of the fleet applies its change locally, then broadcasts it over the app's worker
bus (``instance.app.bus``). :func:`broadcast` is that shared step: it enforces the
two invariants every publisher shares — targets are validated against the presence
census BEFORE any local side effect, and the worker applies locally only when it is
itself a target — then awaits the confirmed broadcast and returns the per-origin
fleet report.

Failure discipline splits the callers into two disciplines, selected by
``publish_on_local_failure``:

* Pure registry/query ops (``reload_mcp``, ``deregister_mcp``, ``reload_tool``,
  ``remove_tool``, ``reload_failed_mcps``, ``list_failed_mcps``) leave it ``False``:
  a failed local apply raises before anything is broadcast, so the siblings stay
  genuinely untouched.
* Convergence and store-backed publishers (both ``reload_config`` doors, the
  connector catalog write) pass ``True``: their persist/convergence intent has
  already committed, so a failed local apply still broadcasts (siblings converge
  on the persisted state) and then re-raises with the fleet report attached — a
  stranded fleet never hides behind a local error.
