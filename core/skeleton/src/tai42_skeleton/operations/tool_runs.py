"""Background tool-run operations — submit, get-by-id, and per-tool list.

The synchronous ``POST /api/run-tool`` door holds one request open for the whole
tool call; a dropped connection loses the result even though the tool finished
server-side. These operations detach the run from the request:

* ``submit_run`` — takes ``tool_name`` + ``arguments`` (the same field shape the
  sync door's parser enforces), returns ``{"run_id": ...}`` at once (the route
  answers ``202``) and executes the tool as an in-process background task through
  the SAME ``tai42_app.tools.run_tool`` seam the sync door uses — with
  ``offload_sync`` set, so a blocking sync tool runs on a worker thread and cannot
  starve the supervisor's liveness refresh. A "run any tool by name" door, so it
  is a tier-1 meta-executor (never projected to the MCP surface, like
  ``run_tool``).
* ``get_run`` — the run record ``{run_id, tool_name, status, started_at,
  finished_at?, result?, error?}``; an unknown/expired id is a loud 404.
  ``status ∈ running | succeeded | failed | lost``.
* ``list_tool_runs`` — the recent runs for one tool (id, tool name, status,
  timestamps only — never ``result``/``error``), newest first, from a per-tool
  ZSET trimmed to ``ToolRunsSettings.recent_runs_limit``.

Per-identity isolation: a run records the OWNING identity of its submitter (always
the caller's OWN id — each key is its own island, never sharing its owner's or a
sibling owned key's slice) and is indexed under a per-identity
``recent:{user_id}:{tool_name}`` window in addition to the shared per-tool window. A
restricted caller reads and prunes only its own per-identity window (complete within
its own bound, never truncated by other identities' volume) and may GET only a run it
owns — another identity's run id is a loud ``403`` (never a ``404``: the run exists,
it is simply not the caller's). An unrestricted caller keeps the full view over the
shared window.

A supervisor wraps each run: it refreshes a per-run liveness key while the tool
runs, writes the terminal record when the tool returns or raises (``succeeded``
+ result, or ``failed`` + the caught error string — the error becomes visible
record data, never swallowed), and in ``finally`` cancels the liveness refresher.
``lost`` is computed-and-persisted one way: the FIRST read of a record still
``running`` whose liveness key has expired writes ``status: lost`` (a dead
process never wrote its terminal record, so it cannot later flip to succeeded).
