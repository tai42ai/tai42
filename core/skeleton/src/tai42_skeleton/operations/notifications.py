"""Notifications operations — read the internal inbox and send a notification.

* ``list_notifications`` returns the deployment's internal notifications feed —
  channel-less sends plus any audience-addressed notification (recorded even when
  a channel also delivers it) — newest-first.
* ``notify_user`` sends a human ONE fire-and-forget message — on a named channel,
  or (channel omitted) recorded to the internal notifications sink the Studio inbox
  reads. No reply, no blocking wait. It delivers over the channels feature's
  ``notify_user`` helper, mapping the helper's loud
  failures to the operation's typed errors: a blank message / unknown channel /
  blank recipient/audience — or a caller-supplied ``sender_identity`` (an
  internal-only control) — is a :class:`BadRequestError` (400), a restricted caller
  addressing another identity is a cross-identity authorization denial mapped to a
  :class:`ForbiddenError` (403) — the same 403 the read-side answer door raises for the
  symmetric read denial — a channel that cannot notify
  is a :class:`NotSupportedError` (501), and a channel delivery failure is an
  :class:`UpstreamError` (502) — a failure is never swallowed.

``notify_user`` causes an external side-effect (a message leaves the deployment),
so it is ``destructive=True``. It is a messaging door, not a privilege-shaping one,
so it is NOT authority-changing and stays a plain (includable) projected tool.

    No reply is expected and nothing blocks. With a named channel the message is
    sent and the call returns as soon as the medium ACCEPTED it (not that a human
    saw it). With ``channel`` omitted the message is recorded to the internal
    notifications sink the Studio inbox reads. One send attempt, no retry; every
    failure raises loudly, never a silent no-op:

    * a blank message, an unknown channel name, a blank recipient/audience, a
      caller-supplied ``sender_identity``, or ``media``/``template`` with no named
      channel → 400;
    * a restricted caller addressing another identity (cross-identity denial) → 403;
    * a channel that cannot notify, or does not advertise the ``media``/``template``
      capability the send needs → 501;
    * a channel delivery failure → 502.

    ``media`` (display media sent with the message) and ``template`` (a pre-approved
    out-of-window send) are OPTIONAL richer-send forms carried to the channel; the
    contract enforces they are mutually exclusive. Each needs a channel that advertises
    the matching capability — otherwise the send is refused as a 501, never downgraded
    to a silent freeform send.

    ``audience`` addresses the in-app record to an identity's feed; it is honored
    even when a channel also delivers the message (channel push AND in-app record).
    ``sender_identity`` is the sending identity a channel message leaves FROM, which the
    conversation bridge sets on the notification it builds to answer a route; a caller may
    not supply it here and a set value is rejected loudly, never forwarded to the channel.

    Returns a short confirmation string — ``"notification sent via '<channel>'"``
    for a channel send, ``"notification recorded to the internal sink"`` otherwise.
