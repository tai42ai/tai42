"""Sub-MCP app registry operations — list, register/reload, and unregister.

Three operations over the DURABLE sub-MCP registration store, which the live
``tai42_app.sub_app.mcp_sub_app_router`` caches per worker:

* ``list_sub_mcp`` reads the durable store (not this worker's in-process cache) so
  the listing is coherent across workers.
* ``register_sub_mcp`` registers (or reloads) a sub-MCP app exposing ``tools``
  under ``slug`` on an optional ``transport``. The write goes through the
  store-first service, so the registration is durable before the in-process router
  swap. An unknown tool is a loud 404; the structural body validation (slug shape,
  transport, tool-name types) is a loud 400 raised by the route's extractor.
* ``unregister_sub_mcp`` unregisters a sub-MCP app and tears down its ASGI
  lifespan; a slug present in NEITHER the store NOR this worker's router is a loud
  404, but a slug registered on a sibling worker is store-only here and is still
  deletable from any worker.

Both mutating operations are reload-gated (they rebind live tools) — the adapter
holds the retriable 503 on the route edge while a reload owns the gate.
