"""Login/logout operations fanning out over the accounts-provider registry.

- ``login_methods`` aggregates every registered accounts provider's declared
  ``LoginMethod`` metadata plus a bootstrap flag, so a generic login screen can
  render without knowing which providers are installed.
- ``logout`` revokes the caller's session by fanning ``revoke_session`` out over
  every presented credential candidate and every registered accounts provider;
  the first ``True`` wins, and no match is a loud 404 (:class:`NotFoundError`).
- ``exchange_claim_token`` burns a one-time claim token and returns the raw API key it
  carried — the public QR-onboarding exchange leg, ``authority_changing`` so it never
  projects as an MCP tool.

Provider factories are instantiated per call and NOT cached: the login fetch is
low-frequency, and ``needs_bootstrap`` must be FRESH so the create-owner screen
disappears the moment the owner exists. Provider errors propagate (loud, never a
silently empty methods list or a silent logout no-op).
