"""The human answer operation for the ask_user interactions surface.

``answer_interaction`` is the authenticated human answer door
(``POST /api/interactions/{interaction_id}/answer``): the value is validated
server-side against the stored question's ``answer_format`` before the blocked
caller is woken; an invalid answer is rejected loudly and the caller stays
blocked. An EXTERNAL question is answered through its callback URL, never here.

The answer-validation helpers (``_validate_answer``, ``_schema_mismatch``, …),
the reply-TTL clamp, and the serializer-guarded claim live here because the
router's still-handler callback door shares the exact same rules — it imports
them from this module (the store claim, the typed-format validation, the reply
TTL). The router's HTTP-edge extractor reads/parses the request body (the byte
cap → 413, invalid JSON / missing ``answer`` → 400) and hands this operation the
already-parsed ``answer`` value.
