"""Manifest + MCP-status operations — ``/api/manifest*``, ``/api/mcp-config*``,
``/api/mcp-status*``.

A thin skin over the live-manifest admin surface (``tai42_app.admin``), the config
manager, the reload gate, and the worker bus (``instance.app.bus``). Two groups:

Reads (each returns its shape directly; the adapter envelopes it):

* ``get_manifest`` — the live manifest's MCP section + user tools.
* ``get_mcp_config_schema`` — the JSON Schema for one MCP-config entry.
* ``get_mcp_status`` — the live MCP binding snapshot.
* ``list_failed_mcps`` — the MCP servers skipped by the viability check; a query op
  over the bus, so every origin's list arrives as its per-origin report payload.

Mutations cross the single :class:`~tai42_skeleton.config.service.ConfigService`
pipeline (validate → persist → local reload → broadcast) or, for pure runtime ops,
the shared :func:`~tai42_skeleton.operations._broadcast.broadcast` primitive. Each is
``destructive`` + ``reload_gated`` and its response embeds the per-origin fleet
report as a ``fanout`` summary:

* ``set_mcp_config`` — replace the manifest's MCP section, persist, and reload the fleet.
* ``reload_mcp`` — re-probe a single MCP server by title (all workers, or only
  ``targets``). An unknown title is a loud 404.
* ``update_manifest`` — replace the WHOLE persisted manifest and reload the whole
  fleet. Authority-changing (it governs ``api_tools`` + module loading), so it is
  tier-2 (off the default MCP surface, includable).
* ``reload_failed_mcps`` — re-probe every failed MCP server.
* ``deregister_mcp`` — detach a single MCP server's tools by title.

The one response shape every ConfigService writer returns from an
:class:`~tai42_skeleton.config.service.ApplyResult` is built by
:func:`~tai42_skeleton.operations._broadcast.apply_response`.
