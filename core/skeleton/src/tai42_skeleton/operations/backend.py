"""Backend identity + the fleet census and the fleet soft-restart.

``backend_info`` reports whether a task :class:`~tai42_contract.backend.Backend`
provider is registered (identity only). The other two operations are FLEET
operations over the app's worker bus, and need no backend at all:

* ``list_workers`` — the live worker fleet from the bus presence census (every
  subscribed process, HTTP server and backend runtime alike). No try/except: a
  presence-store read that cannot read must surface as a ``500``, never an empty
  ``[]``.
* ``fleet_reload_config`` — soft-restart the fleet. The serving worker applies its
  own reload FIRST, then broadcasts the reload; the response embeds the per-origin
  fleet report. A failed local apply does NOT abort
  the broadcast — the door's whole purpose is converging siblings onto persisted
  state — so it publishes anyway and re-raises with the report attached.

``fleet_reload_config`` is named apart from the local-reload ``reload_config`` op
(a different door, ``/api/config/reload``): the fleet soft-restart and the
in-process config reload share no surface.
