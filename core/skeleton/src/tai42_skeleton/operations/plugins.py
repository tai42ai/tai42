"""Studio-plugin registry operation — list the installed plugins' manifest
contents from the startup-built registry.

The plugin asset-serving and SPA-hosting routes are content servers (they answer
file bytes / injected HTML with per-response security headers, not the
``{"data": ...}`` envelope), so they stay handlers in the router. Only the
registry listing is an enveloped-JSON read, so it lives here as an operation. A
registry that has not been built is a loud 500 (:class:`OperationFailed`) rather
than a fabricated empty list.
