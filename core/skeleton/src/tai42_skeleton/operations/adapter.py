"""The route-adapter helper — turns an operation into a thin HTTP route.

An adapter route is declarative: this helper registers the HTTP surface over
:meth:`HttpSurface.custom_route`, and the generated handler parses/validates the
flat typed parameters, calls the operation, wraps the success payload in the
``{"data": ...}`` envelope, and maps the operation's declared errors to statuses.
It honors the reload gate per the operation's metadata and NEVER performs
authorization — that is a separate consumer (the HTTP middleware at the route
edge, ``AuthzMiddleware`` at the tool edge).

    A DELETE route auto-forces the ``destructive`` spec-surface bool on the operation;
    a GET route that declares ``destructive`` is a registration-time error (a read is
    never destructive). ``action`` is the ORTHOGONAL authorization action-class
    (``read``/``write`` derived from the method, or the admin-only ``fenced``/``secret``
    fence declared explicitly) — it never touches the ``destructive`` bool, so a
    ``secret`` GET never trips the GET-destructive guard. The operation's route template
    + method + path params are attached to its metadata so the tool-edge authorization
    can synthesize the concrete resource path.

    ``context_extractor`` derives the operation's non-path kwargs from the raw
    request when they are not a plain request-model parse (header credentials, or a
    body the operation validates itself with its own error classes); when given it
    REPLACES the default request-model parse and ``request_model`` becomes spec
    metadata only.

    ``response_headers`` are static headers stamped on the SUCCESS response only (a
    caching directive the route's read carries, e.g. ``cache-control: no-cache``) —
    the enveloping/status stay the adapter's, so the route surface is unchanged
    apart from the declared headers.

    ``success_status`` is the HTTP status the enveloped success answers with;
    it defaults to ``200`` and is set to ``202`` for an accepted-but-detached
    submission (the background tool-run submit door), so that door answers
