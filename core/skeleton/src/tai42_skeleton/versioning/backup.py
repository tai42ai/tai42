"""Store-level backup export/import for the versioned-document Postgres tables.

Postgres is the durable source of truth for the versioned-document store, so these
helpers operate at the SQL layer directly — NOT through any typed view. The store
is body-opaque and ``kind``-discriminated, so ONE section covers EVERY kind at
once (presets under ``kind='preset'``, AC policies under ``kind='ac_policy'``,
authored agents, and any future kind); no per-kind backup code is ever needed.

The export is a faithful row-level copy of BOTH tables — ``versioned_documents``
(including soft-deleted ghosts, so the audit history survives) and
``versioned_document_versions`` (the full append-only version log). Each row's
synthetic ``id`` is carried verbatim so the ``document_id`` foreign key linking a
version to its document is preserved across the round-trip; the opaque ``body``
JSONB is carried as-is and never inspected. Import re-inserts each row under its
original id (``ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE``), documents before versions so the FK
is satisfied, then advances both ``BIGSERIAL`` sequences past the restored ids so
a later insert cannot collide with a restored id.

Secret constraint: the bodies are opaque and at least one kind is secret-bearing —
a preset's ``fixed_kwargs`` can embed credentials and an AC-policy condition body
is sensitive — so the section is registered ``secret=True`` (default-OFF in the
export UI, treated like a secret), mirroring the connector-connections section.
