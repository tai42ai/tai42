"""Durable sub-MCP registration store, settings, and write service.

Sub-MCP app registrations (``slug -> {tools, transport}``) are per-uvicorn-worker
in-process routing state on the ``SubMcpAppRouter`` (``app/sub_mcp_app.py``). This
package makes them durable and cross-worker-coherent by persisting them to a shared
store (Redis, with a per-process in-memory fallback) that the router treats as its
source of truth: :mod:`settings` selects the backend from ``SUB_MCP_*`` config,
:mod:`store` is the ``slug -> RouteConfig`` seam, and :mod:`service` is the single
write choke point (store write FIRST, then the in-process router swap).

Scope: only the uvicorn HTTP/MCP workers serve ``/app/{slug}`` and use this store.
Backend workers (celery/rq/arq) serve no ``/app/{slug}`` routes and do not
participate, so the worker bus is not the propagation mechanism here.
