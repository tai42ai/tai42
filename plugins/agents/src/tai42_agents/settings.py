"""``TAI_AGENTS_*`` limits shared by the agents in this package.

The concrete ``TaiBaseSettings`` subclass self-registers with the settings
registry, so a live-reload reset re-reads the env with no extra wiring. Every
field carries a positive safe default — never hardcoded at a use site, never
unlimited.
