"""The voting agent — N voter LLMs answer in parallel, one judge LLM decides.

Each ``VoterSpec`` in ``voters`` spawns one voter; a list lets the same provider
appear more than once and each voter pin its own model. Every voter answers the
same rendered ``voter_message`` in parallel, then the judge receives the rendered
``judge_message`` followed by one line per voter (provider, model, verdict) and
decides by majority vote, breaking ties with its own reasoning.

Only the judge streams; the voters run silently in the prelude and their verdicts
are collected before the judge starts. ``astream`` emits the judge's per-step
events and ends with a terminal ``StructuredFinal`` carrying the full
``VotingOutput``; ``run`` drains that stream.
